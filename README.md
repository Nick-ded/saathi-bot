## Disnake Bot Cogs

## Overview

This bot is composed of multiple cogs, each handling a specific function. Below is an overview of the available cogs:

## AI Cog

This AI Cog is a component of the bot that utilizes Google Generative AI to generate responses in a roleplaying style. The bot assumes the persona of Sokudo (速度), a 16-year-old Japanese girl with pink hair. The cog also includes moderation features such as bad word filtering, suicide prevention triggers, and mental health resource recommendations.

### Features

- **AI Chatbot**: Uses Google Generative AI (Gemini-2.0 Flash) for text responses and Gemini-1.5 Pro for image-based responses.
- **Message Filtering**: Replaces and censors bad words in messages.
- **Suicide Prevention**: Detects certain keywords related to self-harm and provides mental health resources.
- **Image Processing**: Accepts images as input for AI-generated responses.
- **Threaded Conversations**: Maintains chat history with context awareness.
- **Mention Handling**: Converts Discord user mentions into display names.
- **Game-Specific Knowledge**: Trained to answer questions about a specific game for a Discord community.
- **Custom Personality**: The AI chatbot is designed with a distinct personality to enhance engagement.


### Environment Variables

The cog requires the following environment variable:

- GAI: Your Google Generative AI API key.


### Usage

The AI Cog automatically listens to messages and responds when:

- The bot is mentioned.
- Certain trigger words (like “depressed”, “suicide”, etc.) are detected.
- A user replies to the bot's previous response.

### Moderation

- Messages containing blacklisted words are filtered and censored.
- If a message includes a trigger word, the bot provides relevant mental health resources.
- The bot will not respond to ^-prefixed messages to allow command execution without interference.

### Configuration

- Modify the bad_words dictionary to add or change word filtering rules.
- Adjust the triggers list to change how the bot detects sensitive topics.
- Customize mhr.json to update mental health resources.
- Modify the AI's behavior to adjust how it responds to game-related queries.

### Error Handling

- If a prompt is blocked by Google's API, the bot will notify users.
- If an unexpected error occurs, the bot logs the error and informs the user.
